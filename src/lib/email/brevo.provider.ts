/**
 * Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) transactional email adapter.
 *
 * Unlike SMS - where each department supplies its own Africa's Talking
 * apiKey/username - email is architected as ONE shared Brevo account for
 * the whole app: a single EMAIL_API_KEY env var, set once. Per-department
 * EmailConfiguration only controls fromAddress/enabled/emailTemplate, not
 * credentials. If a department ever needs its own separate email account,
 * that's a bigger change (credentials would need to move onto
 * EmailConfiguration and be encrypted at rest like SmsConfiguration.apiKey -
 * see src/lib/crypto/field-encryption.ts).
 *
 * Brevo's free tier caps at 300 emails/day account-wide (not per
 * department) - see https://www.brevo.com/pricing/. Nothing in this app
 * enforces that quota; Brevo's API simply starts rejecting sends once it's
 * hit, and that rejection surfaces as an ordinary failed SendEmailResult
 * (logged to NotificationLog, same as any other send failure) rather than
 * anything special-cased here. If dues volume ever regularly exceeds 300
 * emails/day, upgrading the Brevo plan is a billing change, not a code one.
 *
 * A "from" sender must be verified in the Brevo dashboard first - Brevo
 * rejects sends from an unverified address. fromAddress on a department's
 * EmailConfiguration is expected to be one of those verified senders;
 * EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS/EMAIL_FROM_NAME are the account-wide fallback when a
 * department hasn't set its own.
 *
 * https://developers.brevo.com/reference/sendtransacemail
 *
 * Attachments (input.attachments) are sent as Brevo's `attachment` array -
 * base64 content plus a filename, no separate upload step needed. Used for
 * the PDF receipt (see src/lib/receipts-pdf.ts); each one is only a few KB,
 * well under Brevo's per-email size limit.
